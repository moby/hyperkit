qtest : Inline (Unit) Tests for OCaml.

qtest extracts inline unit tests written using a special
syntax in comments. Those tests are then run using the oUnit framework
and the qcheck library.  The possibilities range from trivial tests --
extremely simple to use -- to sophisticated random generation of test cases.
